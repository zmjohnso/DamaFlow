# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm start               # Expo dev server
npm run android         # Run on Android emulator/device
npm run ios             # Run on iOS simulator/device
npm test                # Run full Jest test suite
npm test -- path/to/file.test.ts          # Run a single test file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="test name" # Run a specific test by name
npm run lint            # ESLint
```

**Android APK build** requires Java 21 (not 17, not 25+):
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 21)
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Architecture

DamaFlow is a spaced-repetition kendama practice app. It uses the FSRS v5 algorithm to schedule practice sessions.

### Layer Overview

**Navigation** — Expo Router (file-based). `app/_layout.tsx` initializes the DB, runs migrations, loads stores, and redirects to `/onboarding` if `onboarding_complete` is unset. The four-tab interface lives under `app/(tabs)/`. All navigation paths inside tabs must use the full `/(tabs)/...` prefix — omitting it sends users to `+not-found`.

**State** — Three Zustand stores in `store/`:
- `appStore` — onboarding flag, theme preference (persisted to SQLite settings table)
- `queueStore` — practice queue loaded from DB at startup; `loadQueue()` fetches, sorts, and caps rows in memory; pure helpers `sortQueueItems` / `capNewSkills` are unit-testable
- `sessionStore` — ephemeral session state (current skill, ratings) cleared after each session

**Database** — Expo SQLite via Drizzle ORM. Single connection in `lib/db/client.ts` with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` and `enableChangeListener: true`. Migrations auto-run at startup via `runMigrations()` before any screen renders. All query helpers are in `lib/db/queries.ts`. Schema table order matters (referenced tables before dependents).

**Scheduling** — `lib/fsrs/scheduler.ts` wraps `ts-fsrs`. Two FSRS instances: standard `f` (with learning steps) and `fBulk` (New→Review directly, used during onboarding to pre-fill mastered skills). `toCard()` reconstructs `last_review` from persisted `due` and `scheduled_days` because ts-fsrs v5 needs `elapsed_days`.

**UI** — React Native Paper (Material Design 3). Custom light/dark themes in `lib/theme.ts`. Theme preference is read from the settings table and falls back to the system color scheme.

### Data Flow

User rates a practice attempt → `sessionStore` holds the rating → `schedule()` computes next FSRS state → DB updated via `queries.ts` → `queueStore.loadQueue()` refreshes → queue UI re-renders.

### Key Patterns

- **Dates**: stored as ISO 8601 strings. Queue sectioning uses `new Date().toLocaleDateString('sv')` (Swedish locale → `YYYY-MM-DD`) for local calendar date. Always compare as `Date` objects, not strings.
- **FSRS ratings**: 1=Again, 2=Hard, 3=Good, 4=Easy. States: 0=New, 1=Learning, 2=Review, 3=Relearning.
- **Testing**: DB is mocked at the Jest module level — tests never touch a real SQLite file. Test files are co-located with source (`queries.ts` → `queries.test.ts`).
- **Notifications**: All local (Expo Notifications), no remote push services.
